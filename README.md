# RACONTENT

We provide content recommendation for websites. This is our technical support channel.

## Your instruction to be with us

### 1. Contact us

Send us a request via [contact page](https://racontent.com/contact/) or email **racontent.com@gmail.com**

### 2. Provide us your website's content

We need to collect your website's content to perform our recommendation engine.

You'll create an [API](https://github.com/datanee/racontent/wiki/Website-provides-content#content-api) for us for updating your website's content. If your web's traffic is large, allow us to crawl it so you don't need to create API any more.

A bonus step (optional for you) for [speeding up the process](https://github.com/datanee/racontent/wiki/Speeding-up-the-process). You'll insert our [tracking script](https://github.com/datanee/racontent/wiki/Speeding-up-the-process#tracking-scripts) to your website. Don't worry about that, you can remove it latter.

(Our discovery engine will obtain your users' content earlier, so the faster we can establish it)

Check [detail instruction](https://github.com/datanee/racontent/wiki/Website-provides-content).

### 3. Insert our script to your website

After our confirmation, your website needs to insert our script. After that, your website's users will see the recommendations.

Currently we provide 2 default scripts. Check [detail instruction](https://github.com/datanee/racontent/wiki/Widgets).

Note: to speeding up the whole process, at the beginning you can put our tracking scripts. It helps us build recommendation engine much faster. [Check detail](https://github.com/datanee/racontent/wiki/Speeding-up-the-process).

## That's our pleasure to be with you.
